# Objective
This program utilizes computational mechanics through the Taichi package within the Python environment to enhance the numerical method applied in my master's thesis. Drawing from the Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) Method introduced by Jiang et al. (2015), I formulated a stabilized material point method (FLIP98A) for simulating free surface flow.
